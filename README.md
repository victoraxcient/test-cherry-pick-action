# Cherry-picking a pull request commit into branchs

This action is designed to be used for cherry-pick commits from pull requests into release branches.

GitHub Cherry Pick Action will:

- Checkout triggered action.
- Create new branch name `cherry-pick-${GITHUB_SHA}` from `branch` input.
- Cherry-picking `${GITHUB_SHA}` into created `branch`
- Push new `branch` to remote
- Open pull request to `branch`

> *NOTE:* The `GITHUB_SHA` is taken from the GitHub context, specifically from the `merge_commit_sha` attribute of the pull request object.

## Example

Cherry-picking pull requests merged on main to branch *release-v1.0* in pull requests labeled with **release-v1.0** and to branch *release-v2.0* in pull requests labeled with **release-v2.0**.

```yml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
    types: ["closed"]

jobs:
  cherry_pick_release_v1_0:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Cherry pick into release-v1.0
    if: ${{ contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'release-v1.0') && github.event.pull_request.merged == true }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Cherry pick into release-v1.0
        uses: carloscastrojumo/github-cherry-pick-action@v1.0.1
        with:
          branch: release-v1.0
          labels: |
            cherry-pick
          reviewers: |
            aReviewerUser
  cherry_pick_release_v2_0:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Cherry pick into release-v2.0
    if: ${{ contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'release-v2.0') && github.event.pull_request.merged == true }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Cherry pick into release-v2.0
        uses: carloscastrojumo/github-cherry-pick-action@v1.0.1
        with:
          branch: release-v2.0
          labels: |
            cherry-pick
          reviewers: |
            aReviewerUser
          title: '[cherry-pick] {old_title}'
          body: 'Cherry picking #{old_pull_request_id} onto this branch'
env:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Using outputs:
```yml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  - uses: carloscastrojumo/github-cherry-pick-action@v1.0.1
    id: new-issue
    with:
      branch: release-v2.0
      labels: cherry-pick
    - run: |
        echo "${{ steps.new-issue.outputs.data }}"
        echo "${{ steps.new-issue.outputs.number }}" 
        echo "${{ steps.new-issue.outputs.html_url }}"
```
### Working with forked repositories

If you are using this action while working with forked repositories (e.g. when you get pull requests from external contributors), you will have to adapt the trigger to avoid permission problems.

In such a case you should use the `pull_request_target` trigger, which was introduced by github for this usecase.

### Example 

```yml
on:
  pull_request_target:
    branches:
      - main
    types: ["closed"]
 ...
```
